//! Persisted tax lots.
//!
//! A [`LotRecord`] is the durable, relational form of a tax lot: one row per
//! acquisition (or transferred sub-lot), updated in-place as shares are disposed.
//! This is distinct from the in-memory [`crate::portfolio::snapshot::Lot`], which
//! is a computation intermediate produced by the holdings calculator.
//!
//! Lot rows are initially written alongside the existing JSON snapshot path as a
//! parallel record. Quantity mismatches between the two representations are logged
//! at CRITICAL severity so they can be caught before the lots table becomes
//! the authoritative source.
//!
//! Lots that map directly to an activity keep that activity's id in
//! `open_activity_id`. Synthetic sub-lots that do not correspond to an activity
//! row leave it NULL to preserve the foreign-key constraint.
