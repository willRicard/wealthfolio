//! `EconomicEvent`: the single economics authority (architecture §4.2). Every
//! downstream stage reads these; nobody re-interprets raw activities.
//!
//! An event says what an activity MEANS — signed cash, charges, the position
//! action, the net-contribution rule, and the external-flow classification —
//! without touching state. `project` applies actions to lots and cash;
//! `value` prices flows that need quotes.
