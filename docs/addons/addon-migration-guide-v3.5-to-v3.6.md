# Migration Guide: Wealthfolio Addons v3.5 to v3.6

> Migrating beyond v3.6? Continue with the
> [v3.6 to v3.7 guide](./addon-migration-guide-v3.6-to-v3.7.md) for packaged
> assets and development-server compatibility.

Wealthfolio 3.6 runs every addon inside an **isolated sandbox iframe**
(`sandbox="allow-scripts"`, opaque origin) instead of in the main app runtime.
The iframe boundary cannot pass live functions or React elements across it, so
the way addons register routes, access React, and bundle shared libraries all
changed. **Every addon that renders a route must be updated** — a 3.5-era addon
will not render in 3.6.

> If you are still on the v2 → v3 SDK, do that migration first (see
> [addon-migration-guide-v2-to-v3.md](./addon-migration-guide-v2-to-v3.md)),
> then follow this guide.

## 1. Route registration: `component` → `render`

This is the breaking change that affects every addon. The host can no longer
receive a lazy React component and mount it in its own tree — the addon renders
itself into a DOM node the sandbox hands it.

**Before (v3.5):**

```tsx
ctx.router.add({
  path: "/addon/my-addon",
  component: React.lazy(() => import("./pages/MainPage")),
});
```

**After (v3.6):**

```tsx
import { createRoot, type Root } from "react-dom/client";
import { MainPage } from "./pages/MainPage";

export default function enable(ctx: AddonContext) {
  let root: Root | null = null;

  ctx.router.add({
    path: "/addon/my-addon",
    render: ({ root: routeRoot }) => {
      root ??= createRoot(routeRoot);
      root.render(<MainPage ctx={ctx} />);
    },
  });

  ctx.onDisable(() => {
    root?.unmount();
    root = null;
  });
}
```

Notes:

- `render` receives `{ root, location }` (`AddonRouteRenderContext`). `root` is
  the `HTMLElement` to mount into; `location` is
  `{ pathname, search, hash, params }` (`AddonRouteLocation`) for reading route
  params.
- Create the React root **once** and reuse it across renders (`root ??=`), then
  `unmount()` in `onDisable`. Calling `createRoot` on every render leaks.
- `RouteConfig` also gained optional `id` (stable route id) and `title` (used
  for diagnostics).

### Preferred (3.6.1+): `component` instead of `render`

Managing the React root by hand is the #1 source of breakage — a per-route
`createRoot` (or one root per route) leaves an **orphaned tree** whose
re-renders never reach the DOM, so buttons and navigation silently stop working.
As of 3.6.1 you can hand the host a component and let it own the single root:

```tsx
import { MainPage } from "./pages/MainPage";

export default function enable(ctx: AddonContext) {
  ctx.router.add({
    path: "/addon/my-addon",
    component: MainPage, // host mounts/unmounts this in its managed root
  });
}
```

- Provide **exactly one** of `component` or `render`. If both are set,
  `component` wins; if neither, the host rejects the route.
- With `component`, do **not** call `createRoot` yourself and you don't need an
  `onDisable` unmount for the route — the host manages the lifecycle.
- The sandbox has **no react-router provider**, so do not call `useLocation()` /
  `useParams()` inside a `component` route — they throw. The host passes the
  current location as a **prop** (`{ location }`, an `AddonRouteLocation` with
  `pathname/search/hash/params`), re-passed on each navigation.
- Prefer `component`; keep `render` only for non-React or imperative rendering.

> **`contributes.routes` + `contributes.links`:** addons can declare their pages
> and navigation in the manifest, so the host knows them without booting the
> addon. A **route** is a durable addon page; a **link** places it in a host
> slot (only `"sidebar"` is consumed today) and must reference a declared route
> id of the same addon:
>
> ```jsonc
> "contributes": {
>   "routes": [ { "id": "main" } ],
>   "links": {
>     "sidebar": [
>       { "id": "main-nav", "route": "main", "label": "My Addon", "icon": "wallet", "order": 150 }
>     ]
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> The host mounts that root route at `/addons/<manifest.id>`. For a nested page,
> provide only a relative suffix such as `"path": "reports/:year"`; absolute
> paths are rejected.
>
> If you declare a route and also register its renderer at runtime, the runtime
> `router.add({ id })` **must use the same id** as the declared route
> (`contributes.routes[].id`). A mismatch renders a blank page ("route is not
> available"). A route without any link is legal — it is deep-link only.

---

## 2. React is no longer an SDK export

The SDK used to re-export the host's React via `window` globals. Those exports
(`React`, `ReactDOM`) are **removed**. Import React normally — your bundle marks
it `external` (step 4) and the sandbox provides the real instance at runtime, so
you still share one React with the host.

**Before:**

```tsx
import { React, ReactDOM } from "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk";
```

**After:**

```tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
// hooks/JSX: import from 'react' as usual
```

`ReactVersion` is still exported (now `19.2.4`) if you need to assert a version
at runtime. The new `HOST_DEPENDENCIES` export lists every version the sandbox
guarantees.

---

## 3. Sidebar items: `icon` string only, no `onClick`

The iframe boundary can't carry a React node or a click handler, so
`SidebarItemConfig` tightened:

**Before:**

```tsx
ctx.sidebar.addItem({
  id: "my-addon",
  label: "My Addon",
  icon: <MyIcon />, // React node
  onClick: () => navigate(), // handler
});
```

**After:**

```tsx
ctx.sidebar.addItem({
  id: "my-addon",
  label: "My Addon",
  icon: "wallet", // one of the supported icon names (see below)
  route: "/addon/my-addon", // navigate via route instead of onClick
  order: 100,
});
```

### Supported icon names

The `icon` string must be one of a curated set of **duotone Phosphor** icons the
host bundles — the sidebar is host chrome, so the host draws it, and an addon
can't ship its own sidebar icon across the sandbox boundary. The set is exported
from the SDK as the `AddonIconName` type, so if you type your icon against it
you get autocomplete and a compile error on any invalid name:

```ts
import type { AddonIconName } from "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk";

const icon: AddonIconName = "wallet"; // ✓
// const icon: AddonIconName = "spinner"; // ✗ type error
```

Matching is **case- and separator-insensitive** (`"ChartLine"`, `"chart-line"`,
and `"chartline"` all resolve to the same icon). An unrecognized or omitted name
renders a neutral `caret-right` fallback rather than erroring.

> This restriction applies **only to the sidebar/nav icon**. Inside your addon's
> own route/page you render with your own React, so you can use any icon you
> like there (e.g. `import { Rocket } from "lucide-react"`).

The 80 supported names, by group:

**Money & finance** — `wallet`, `coins`, `dollar`, `dollar-circle`, `bank`,
`credit-card`, `piggy-bank`, `receipt`, `invoice`, `hand-coins`, `vault`,
`chart-line-up`, `chart-line`, `trend-up`, `trend-down`, `percent`, `scales`,
`calculator`

**Charts & analytics** — `chart-bar`, `chart-pie`, `chart-pie-slice`,
`chart-donut`, `gauge`, `target`, `presentation`

**Assets** — `house`, `buildings`, `car`, `airplane`, `bicycle`, `diamond`,
`bitcoin`, `storefront`, `briefcase`, `package`, `cube`

**General** — `star`, `heart`, `gift`, `trophy`, `medal`, `lightning`,
`sparkle`, `bell`, `tag`, `bookmark`, `flag`, `fire`, `rocket`, `lightbulb`,
`graduation-cap`, `barbell`, `fork-knife`, `coffee`, `wine`, `shopping-cart`,
`shopping-bag`, `basket`

**Time & place** — `calendar`, `calendar-dots`, `calendar-check`, `clock`,
`hourglass`, `globe`, `map-pin`, `compass`

**Productivity** — `folder`, `files`, `notebook`, `clipboard-text`,
`list-checks`, `sliders`, `wrench`, `toolbox`, `puzzle-piece`,
`plugs-connected`, `app-window`, `squares-four`, `stack`, `kanban`

> **Heads up if you're upgrading an existing addon.** The pre-3.6 icon list was
> different — names like `blocks`, `dashboard`, `settings`, `holdings`, `goal`,
> `fee`, and `chart` are **no longer supported** and now render the neutral
> `caret-right` fallback (no error). Only `wallet`, `target`, `calendar`,
> `invoice`, `receipt`, and `puzzle-piece` carried over. Re-check your `icon`
> against the list above — typing it as `AddonIconName` turns any dropped name
> into a compile error instead of a silent fallback.

## 4. Build config: externalize host dependencies (ESM)

Addons no longer bundle React et al., and the old
`rollup-plugin-external-globals` global-variable mapping
(`{ 'react-dom': 'ReactDOM' }`) no longer applies — there are no globals in the
sandbox. Mark the host-provided packages as ESM `external` with their **bare
specifiers**:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

const hostProvidedDependencies = [
  "@tanstack/react-query",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk/host-api",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk/host-dependencies",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk/manifest",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk/permissions",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk/types",
  "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk/utils",
  "@wealthfolio/ui",
  "@wealthfolio/ui/chart",
  "date-fns",
  "lucide-react",
  "react",
  "react-dom",
  "react-dom/client",
  "react/jsx-dev-runtime",
  "react/jsx-runtime",
  "recharts",
];

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  build: {
    target: ["chrome107", "edge107", "firefox104", "safari16"],
    lib: {
      entry: "src/addon.tsx",
      fileName: () => "addon.js",
      formats: ["es"],
    },
    outDir: "dist",
    rollupOptions: { external: hostProvidedDependencies },
  },
});
```

Anything you import that is **not** in this list is bundled into your
`addon.js`. Only the versions the host guarantees (see `HOST_DEPENDENCIES` in
the SDK) should be externalized.

---

## 5. Manifest changes

Add `minWealthfolioVersion` and `hostDependencies`, and bump `sdkVersion`:

```json
{
  "sdkVersion": "3.6.0",
  "minWealthfolioVersion": "3.6.0",
  "hostDependencies": {
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.90.0",
    "@wealthfolio/addon-sdk": "^3.6.0",
    "@wealthfolio/ui": "^3.6.0",
    "date-fns": "^4.1.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.561.0",
    "react": "^19.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.0",
    "recharts": "^3.7.0"
  }
}
```

- `minWealthfolioVersion: "3.6.0"` makes the host refuse to load the addon on
  pre-sandbox builds (where the new render API doesn't exist), instead of
  loading it and failing at render time. Set it as soon as you adopt `render`.
- `hostDependencies` must match the packages you externalize in step 4. Keep the
  version ranges aligned with `HOST_DEPENDENCIES` in the installed SDK.

---

## 6. New capability: brokered network requests

Sandboxed addons can't make arbitrary `fetch` calls (opaque origin + CSP). To
reach an external API, declare the hosts in the manifest and call through the
host broker, which also injects auth from scoped secret storage:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "allowedHosts": ["api.example.com"]
  }
}
```

```ts
const res = await ctx.api.network.request({
  url: "https://api.example.com/v1/quote",
  method: "GET",
  auth: { type: "bearer", secretKey: "example-api-key" }, // resolved from ctx.api.secrets
});
// res: { status, headers, body }
```

Store the token once with `ctx.api.secrets.set('example-api-key', token)`; the
broker reads it by `secretKey` so the raw token never enters addon code paths.

`auth.type` accepts `"bearer"` (injects `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`) or
`"basic"` (injects `Authorization: Basic <secret>`). For `"basic"`, store the
already base64-encoded `user:pass` string as the secret — the broker only
prefixes the scheme.

---

## 7. New capability: durable storage (replaces `localStorage`)

`localStorage`/`sessionStorage` throw in the opaque-origin sandbox — the common
cause of a "Save" button that silently does nothing in 3.6. Use the durable
storage API instead. It's a **baseline capability** (no `permissions` entry),
per-addon scoped, survives updates, is cleared on uninstall, and replicates
across the user's paired devices.

```ts
// before (throws in the sandbox)
localStorage.setItem("prefs", JSON.stringify(prefs));
const prefs = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("prefs") ?? "{}");

// after
await ctx.api.storage.set("prefs", JSON.stringify(prefs));
const raw = await ctx.api.storage.get("prefs"); // string | null
const prefs = raw ? JSON.parse(raw) : {};
```

The API is async (`get`/`set`/`delete` all return promises). Constraints:

- **Keys**: ≤ 128 chars, charset `[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]`.
- **Values**: ~250 KB each. Because storage syncs across devices, `set` rejects
  an oversized value rather than failing silently later — split large data
  across keys, and don't put device-local caches in storage.

---

## 8. Testing your migration

1. **Build**: `pnpm build` — confirm `addon.js` does **not** bundle React
   (externalized) and TypeScript compiles.
2. **Dev mode**: run the host with
   `VITE_ENABLE_ADDON_DEV_MODE=true pnpm tauri dev`, then `pnpm dev:server` in
   the addon directory.
3. **Verify render**: open the addon route and confirm the page paints inside
   the sandbox (not a blank frame).
4. **Verify lifecycle**: toggle the addon off/on — `onDisable` should
   `unmount()` cleanly with no console errors.

## 9. Common issues

| Symptom                                        | Cause / fix                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Timed out … during loading sandbox document"  | Host build issue (e.g. CSP `frame-ancestors`) or `minWealthfolioVersion` newer than the host. |
| Blank frame, no errors                         | Still using `component:` — switch to `render` and mount into `ctx.root`.                      |
| Two React copies / hook errors                 | `react`/`react-dom` not in the `external` list — they got bundled. Add them (step 4).         |
| `React is undefined` / `ReactDOM is undefined` | Removed SDK exports. Import from `react` / `react-dom/client` directly.                       |
| Sidebar icon missing                           | `icon` must be a host icon name string, not a React node.                                     |
| `fetch` blocked                                | Use `ctx.api.network.request()` with the host declared in `manifest.network.allowedHosts`.    |
| `SecurityError` / dead Save button             | `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` throw in the sandbox — use `ctx.api.storage` (step 7).        |
| Storage `set` rejects a value                  | Value exceeds ~250 KB. Split across keys; storage syncs across devices, which bounds size.    |
