# Accounting contract fixtures

These fixtures are the shared accounting contract for activity semantics.

- `activity_semantics.json` defines the expected cash, net-contribution,
  performance, spending, and income effect of one activity.
- `ledger_scenarios.json` defines whole-ledger reconciliations. These catch
  individually plausible classifications that produce an impossible result when
  combined.

The core flow classifier, holdings calculator, performance calculation, and
spending classifier consume the same cases. Import and form tests verify that
the boundary metadata required by those cases survives activity creation.

## Required invariants

- `gain = ending cash + investment value - net contribution` for the simple cash
  scenarios represented here.
- A fully reversed external purchase has zero net spending and zero gain.
- An explicit `metadata.flow.is_external` value overrides a credit subtype's
  default performance boundary.
- Brokerage refunds without an explicit external boundary remain internal.
- Cash-account expense reversals created by supported entry paths carry an
  explicit external boundary.

When adding or changing an accounting activity, update the atomic contract, add
a ledger scenario when the activity reverses or pairs with another entry, and
cover its import or form path. Randomized tests should enforce invariants; they
should not duplicate the production formula as their oracle.
